 # How to play
 
 - Press **Run My Code** to start the game;
 - Press the **plunger** to start charging it, release to shoot the ball;
 - Press on each **flipper** to control them (or click in the middle of them to use both at the same time);
 - Have fun!
 
 You might notice there are a few other objects we didn't see before.
 
 Try aiming the ball at them to figure out what each of them do.
 ___
 
 *If the last ball in the playfield drains, just wait a little while and a new ball will pop above the plunger*
