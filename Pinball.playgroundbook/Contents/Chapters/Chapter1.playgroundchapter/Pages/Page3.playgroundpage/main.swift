 # How to play
 
 - Tap "PLAY" to start the game;
 - Tap and hold the **plunger** to start charging it, release to shoot the ball;
 - Tap on each **flipper** to flip them (or click in the middle of both to use them at the same time);
 - You have 3 lifes (balls). If you lose them all, it's game over. To start the game again, just tap "PLAY AGAIN";
 - Try to accumulate as many points as possible and have fun!
 ___
 
 You might notice there are a few other objects we didn't see before.
 
 Try aiming the ball at them to figure out what each of them do.
 ___
 
 *If the last ball in the playfield drains, just wait a little while and a new ball will pop above the plunger*
